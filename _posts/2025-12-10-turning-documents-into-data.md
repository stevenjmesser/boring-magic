Since November 2024, we’ve been working on a product which uses artificial intelligence to extract data from planning documents. 

We’re learning lots from users at local planning authorities during the alpha phase. We’re testing the second prototype this week, generating insights that won’t only help us design a better product but that will also feed into the launch and adoption strategy. 

You can follow along by reading the [open weeknotes for Extract](https://digital-land.github.io/extract-alpha/weeknotes/) that we’re writing. 

Keep an eye out for a case study in 2026.
