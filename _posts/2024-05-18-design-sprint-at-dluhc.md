description: "For the last five days, we’ve been looking at how we can make it easier for local planning authorities (LPAs) to provide data to our specifications. Instead of doing that in a standard delivery cycle, the team assembled in London for a design sprint."

Since March 2024, I've been working on the [planning data platform](https://planning.data.gov.uk) at Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC). The [platform is in public beta](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/beta-team/), providing an index of data from local planning authorities and making it available for use in analysis and digital services. The core tech is there, and it’s being used by real people and organisations.

The beta stage is all about iteration. Meeting users’ needs by extending the core functionality set. After reviewing the platform with the service owner and teams working on it, I spotted a few gaps preventing it being a minimum viable product for data providers. 

With forty-three organisations ready to start using the platform, we really needed to fill those gaps fast. So I organised a design sprint with the team so that we could identify solutions rapidly. 

I’ve written it up on the [Digital Land blog](https://digital-land.github.io/blog-post/jamming-together/). Go take a look.
