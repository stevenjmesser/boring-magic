title: Boring Magic
---

Helping you build products and services that meet people’s expectations. No hype, no fluff. 

Good, straightforward stuff that _just works_.

### About Boring Magic

Boring Magic is a digital product consultancy run by [Steve Messer](https://visitmy.website/about){:target="_blank"}. Working independently or alongside others, we make online things better for everyday people. 

### What we do

Our specialty is thinking big but starting small, and making complex things more simple. The unsexy stuff that needs to get done. 

We look at what you’re doing, how, and what you want to achieve. And then we take steps forward together. 

That might mean:

- reviewing your vision or strategy
- getting a new thing off the ground (0 → 1)
- progressing a thing to its next stage (1 → _n_)
- catalysing delivery teams
- nurturing community and culture, or
- training, coaching and mentoring.

### Who we’ve worked with

You might be from government, a local authority, the third sector, a large company or a startup. We’ve worked with organisations like yours before.
