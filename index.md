Helping you build products and services that meet people’s expectations. No hype, no fluff. 

Good, straightforward stuff that _just works_.

### About Boring Magic

Boring Magic is a digital product consultancy run by [Steve Messer](https://visitmy.website/about){:target="_blank"}. Working independently or alongside others, we make online things better for everyday people. 

Our specialty is thinking big but starting small, and making complex or tedious things more simple. The unsexy stuff that needs to get done in modern life: like claiming tax credits, registering for financial support, or finding somewhere to live. We exist to make these things better, to [make the boring feel like magic](https://visitmy.website/2020/01/08/boring-magic/){:target="_blank"}. 

### What we do

We look at what you’re doing, how, and what you want to achieve. And then we take steps forward together. 

That might mean:

- [reviewing your vision or strategy](/services/reviewing-your-vision-or-strategy/)
- [setting up your product foundations](/services/setting-up-your-product-foundations/)
- [helping you develop your product roadmap](/services/designing-your-value-architecture/)
- [getting a new thing off the ground (0 → 1)](/services/discovery-and-prototyping/)
- [progressing a thing to its next stage (1 → _n_)](/services/leading-a-team/)
- [reviewing your product operating or delivery model](/services/reviewing-your-product-operating-or-delivery-model/)
- [catalysing delivery teams](/services/catalysing-delivery-teams/), or
- [training, coaching and mentoring](/services/training-coaching-mentoring/).

If you need a designer or a developer too, we can tap into our network.

Look at our [services](/services/) for more detail.
