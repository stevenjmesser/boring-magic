🏗️ **Busy until end of March 2026**

Right now we’re working on the [planning data platform](https://planning.data.gov.uk/){:target="_blank"} at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) too. We’ve handed over [Extract](https://digital-land.github.io/extract-alpha/){:target="_blank"}, one of the Prime Minister’s AI exemplar projects. We’ll be working with MHCLG until the end of March 2026.

I’m still available for coaching or training in the evenings. Take a look at [what I can help you with](/services/) and [get in touch](/contact/) for a chat.
