🏗️ **Busy until end of March 2026**

Right now I’m working on [Extract](), one of the Prime Minister's AI exemplar projects. I’m still helping out with the [planning data platform](https://planning.data.gov.uk/) at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) too. I’ll be working on these until the end of March 2025.

I’m still available for coaching or training in the evenings. Take a look at [what I can help you with](/services) and [get in touch](/contact) for a chat.
