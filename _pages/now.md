🏗️ **Busy until end of May 2025**

Right now I’m working on the [planning data platform](https://planning.data.gov.uk/) at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) until the end of May 2025.

✅ **Available from July 2025 onwards**

I'll have 1–2 days per week free, starting July 2025. Take a look at [what I can help you with](/services) and [get in touch](/contact) for a chat.
