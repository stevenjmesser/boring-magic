🏗️ **Busy until end of September 2025**

Right now I’m working on the [planning data platform](https://planning.data.gov.uk/) at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) until the end of September 2025.

I’m still available for coaching or training in the evenings. Take a look at [what I can help you with](/services) and [get in touch](/contact) for a chat.
