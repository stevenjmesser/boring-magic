Our primary expertise is product management, user-centred service design, and ways of working from the world of tech. 

Modern work is complex, so we’re not limited to a specific set of services. We look at what you’re doing, how, and what you want to achieve. And then we take steps forward together.

We’re mostly hired to help teams get off the ground, grow, scale or adapt. You bring the vision and we’ll work with you to achieve it.

## Reviewing your vision or strategy

A captivating vision is essential for inspiring action. Strategies work best when they’re simple, clear and set boundaries. 

We’ll spend two weeks talking to you and your team, researching the landscape, and let you know what might need changing.

## Setting up your product foundations

People, process, tools. You need to pick the right combination to start shipping early and consistently. 

We’ll work with your teams to establish the foundations and coach them through the first few cycles.

## Reviewing your product operating model

There is no one-size-fits-all process for how teams work. How you combine evidence and insights to deliver value for users is context-specific and people-driven.

Over six cycles or sprints, we’ll identify opportunities to improve quality, efficiency and agency, implementing the most fruitful changes.

## Catalysing delivery teams

People are your most important asset, and constant change can be tiring – especially in a transforming world.

By conducting team interviews and workshops over three weeks, we’ll get an understanding of team health, help people re-energise or ramp up, and give you the tools to check everyone’s doing OK.

## Training, coaching, mentoring

Mastering one’s discipline can take a lifetime, but you have to start somewhere. Always be learning.

After an initial assessment of your goals, we’ll develop a plan to help you learn new skills, take a step up, or gain confidence in your methods. At least three hours every month.

## Leading a team

Whether you’re getting a new thing off the ground (0 → 1) or progressing a thing to its next stage (1 → _n_), we can join your team as a head, principal or senior product person. Minimum six months.
