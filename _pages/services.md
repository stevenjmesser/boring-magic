Our primary expertise is product management, user-centred service design, and ways of working from the world of tech. 

Modern work is complex, so weâ€™re not limited to a specific set of services. We look at what youâ€™re doing, how, and what you want to achieve. And then we take steps forward together.

Weâ€™re mostly hired to help teams get off the ground, grow or scale. You bring the vision and weâ€™ll work with you to achieve it.

## Reviewing your vision or strategy

A captivating vision is essential for inspiring action. Strategies work best when theyâ€™re simple, clear and set boundaries. 

Weâ€™ll spend two weeks talking to you and your team, researching the landscape, and let you know what might need changing. (And if itâ€™s a growth strategy, weâ€™ll look at channels and key health metrics too.)

## Discovery and prototyping 

Usersâ€™ needs. Your organisationâ€™s goals. A solution that meets both. Itâ€™s the messy middle.

Over eight to sixteen weeks, weâ€™ll iterate rapidly through the cycle of understanding the problem and exploring the solutions. Weâ€™ll find out whatâ€™s valuable, viable, feasible and usable, setting you up for the beta build phase.

## ðŸ†• Building and launching

We all want to solve usersâ€™ problems today. But if you donâ€™t have capacity right now, youâ€™ll want to call in some help.

In partnership with our trusted developer and designer, weâ€™ll work with you to get an MVP or new feature built and launched. (Weâ€™ve built AI-enabled products too.)

## Setting up your product foundations

People, process, tools. You need to pick the right combination to start shipping early and consistently. 

Weâ€™ll work with your teams to establish the foundations and coach them through the first few cycles.

## Reviewing your product operating model

There is no one-size-fits-all process for how teams work. How you combine evidence and insights to deliver value for users is context-specific and people-driven.

Over six cycles or sprints, weâ€™ll identify opportunities to improve quality, efficiency and agency, implementing the most fruitful changes.

## Designing your value architecture

Your actions wonâ€™t deliver value by accident. The most successful products and services have sewn the golden thread between vision, strategy, objectives, key results and other indicators. 

Over four to six weeks, weâ€™ll map out your current or planned value ecosystem, identify misalignments or gaps, and design a coherent architecture that maximises value for users while building sustainable advantage. Weâ€™ll ensure your technology, distribution channels, and business model work together as a unified system.

## Catalysing delivery teams

People are your most important asset, and constant change can be tiring â€“ especially in a transforming world.

By conducting team interviews and workshops over three weeks, weâ€™ll get an understanding of team health, help people re-energise or ramp up, and give you the tools to check everyoneâ€™s doing OK.

## Training, coaching, mentoring

Mastering oneâ€™s discipline can take a lifetime, but you have to start somewhere. Always be learning.

After an initial assessment of your goals, weâ€™ll develop a plan to help you learn new skills, take a step up, or gain confidence in your methods. At least three hours every month.

## Leading a team

Whether youâ€™re getting a new thing off the ground (0 â†’ 1) or progressing a thing to its next stage (1 â†’ _n_), we can join your team as a head, principal or senior product person. Minimum six months.
